   Hello! Iâ€™m Sinovia and I am a versatile and flexible front-end developer and operations professional who specializes in managing projects and organizing people to solve problems.
   I am transitioning to a career in development after spending several years as a theatrical production manager, volunteer coordinator,  and most recently as the operations manager of a code school.
   I specialize in the process of making big ideas real through clear communication, thoughtful coordination, and deliberate action.</p>
